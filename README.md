# 🛒 E-Commerce User Behavior Analysis

Analyze user sessions on an e-commerce platform to understand customer behavior, optimize sales funnels, and uncover actionable business insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores synthetic user activity data on an e-commerce site to:
- Track customer journeys through the funnel (Product → Cart → Checkout → Payment)
- Identify conversion bottlenecks
- Analyze session-level metrics (bounce rate, time on page, cart value)
- Segment users by device/browser behavior
- Provide data-driven insights for business growth

---

## 🧠 Key Questions Answered

- What percentage of users convert at each funnel stage?
- How do cart values differ across device types?
- Which browsers show higher purchase intent?
- What are the peak shopping times?
- Can we predict purchase likelihood based on session behavior?

## 📈 Business Insights
💳 Only 8.4% of sessions resulted in a purchase, highlighting a large drop-off in the sales funnel.
📱 Mobile users had a 25% lower average cart value than desktop users, suggesting potential UX or trust issues on mobile.
🌐 Chrome users converted 2x more often than Safari users, possibly due to better performance or compatibility.
⏰ Peak activity occurs between 6 PM and 9 PM, making this the ideal window for promotions and retargeting ads.
🛒 Abandonment rate is highest at the Checkout stage (42%), indicating friction that may be resolved with UI/UX improvements or payment flexibility.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add basic ML model to predict purchases (classification)
- Deploy dashboard to share results
- Compare behavior across weekday/weekend sessions
